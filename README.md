### Install & run with gulp connect

```
$ git clone https://github.com/sjt88/graphApp.git
$ cd graphApp
$ npm install
$ gulp
```

point your browser to http://localhost:8080

If gulp isn't installed globally you might have to do so after cloning & before running gulp:
```
$ npm install -g gulp
```


alternatively, the app's contained in the src folder :)
